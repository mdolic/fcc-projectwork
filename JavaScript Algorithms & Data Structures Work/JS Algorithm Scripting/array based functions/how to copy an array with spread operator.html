        <!--While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

                In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
                
                let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
                let thatArray = [...thisArray];
                // thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]
                // thisArray remains unchanged, and is identical to thatArray
                
                We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as 
                arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. 
                We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. 
                Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly 
                (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).-->

    <script>
    
    function copyMachine(arr, num) {  //takes in arguments of a new array and a numb
  let newArr = []; //creates a new arrray here which is empty
  while (num >= 1) {  //than says while num is greater or equal to 1 do the below code
    // change code below this line
  newArr.push([...arr]);  //newArr add the arr arguments and spreadd them into arr
    // change code above this line
   num--; //this is needed in order to separate the # of arrays out from the push method above
  }
  return newArr;
}

// change code here to test different cases:
console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 1));
