        requirements
        1. return true if the string in the first element of the array contains
        all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array

        example: ["hello","HELLO"] should return true since all characters are the same

        guide tips:

        1. change everyhting to lowers case to compare easier
        2. our strings might be easier to work with if they were arrays of characters
        3. a loop might help. use String.indexOf to chek if the letter of the second word 
        is on the first

    */
    function mutation(arr){

       /*
       step1: we make two strings in the array lower case with testArr & targetArr
        test will hold what we are looking for in target
        step 2: loop through our test characters and if any of them are not found we return flase

        if they are all found, loop will finish wihtout return anything and we get to return true

       */
     let testArr = arr[1].toLowerCase();
     let targetArr = arr[0].toLowerCase();

    function mutation2(arr){
        /*
            grab the second string, lowercase and turn it into an array. make sure every one of its letters is a part of the lowercased first string

            Every will basically give you a letter by letter to compare, which we do by using indexOf() on the first string
            indexOf() will you -1 if the current letter is missing. We check that not to be the case, for if this happens even once every
            will be false.
