        how to factorialize a number
         1. return a factorial of the provided integer
         2. if the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial
         is the product of all positive numbers
         3. factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!.
         example: 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
        test cases
        factorialize(0) should return 1
        factorialize (1) should return 120
        factorialize(10) should return 3628800
        factoalize (20) should return kdsfa
        when you factoralize a num you are multiplying that num
        by each consecutive num minus one
        if you num is 5 you would have this
        5*4*3*2*1
    */
    function factorialize(num){
        //num = number
        //if the num is less than 0, reject it!
        if(num <0)
        return -1;// can also use console.log here('hello');
        //if the num is 0, its factorial is 1
        else if(num == 0)
        return 1;
        //else, call the recursive procedure again
        else{
            return (num * factorialize(num -1));
        }
    }
    factorialize(5);
