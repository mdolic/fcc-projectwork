    /* can use bracket notation as a way to acces property values using the valuation of a valriable
        imagine that our foods object is being used in a program for a supermarket cash register
        We have some function that sets the selectedFood and we want to check our foods object for the
        presence of that food. 

        this will look like this: 

        let selectedFood = getCurrentFood(scannedItem);
        let inventory = foods[selectedFood];

        This code will evaluate the value stored in the selectedFood variable and 
        return the value of that key in the foods object, or undefined if it is not present. 
        Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before 
        runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.
