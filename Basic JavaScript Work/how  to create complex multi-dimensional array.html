        /*
        One of the most powerful features when thinking of arrays as data structures, 
        is that arrays can contain, or even be completely made up of other arrays. 
        We have seen arrays that contain arrays in previous challenges, but fairly simple ones. 
        However, arrays can contain an infinite depth of arrays that can contain other arrays, each 
        with their own arbitrary levels of depth, and so on. In this way, an array can very quickly
         become very complex data structure, known as a multi-dimensional, or nested array. 
         Consider the following example:
        let nestedArray = [ // top, or first level - the outer most array
                ['deep'], // an array within an array, 2 levels of depth
                [
                    ['deeper'], ['deeper'] // 2 arrays nested 3 levels deep
                ],
                [
                    [
                    ['deepest'], ['deepest'] // 2 arrays nested 4 levels deep
                    ],
                    [
                    [
                        ['deepest-est?'] // an array nested 5 levels deep
                    ]
                    ]
                ]
                ];

        */

        // complex multi-dimensional array 
        /*Modify myNestedArray, using any combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for 
        data elements, so that it has exactly five levels of depth 
        (remember, the outer-most array is level 1). 
        Somewhere on the third level, include the string 'deep', on the fourth level, include the 
        string 'deeper', and on the fifth level, include the string 'deepest'.*/

        let myNestedArray = [
                // change code below this line
                ['unshift', false, 1, 2, 3, 'complex', 'nested'],//level 2
                    [
                        ['loop', 'shift', 6, 7, 1000, 'method'] //level 3
